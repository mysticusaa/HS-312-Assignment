# HS-312-Assignment - Getting Personal with Data: Production and Visualisation/Visceralization of a Dataset

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for my HS 312 - Introduction to Science and Technology Studies assignment. The project visualizes personal smartphone screen time data collected between April 1-May 3, 2025, exploring patterns in digital consumption through data visceralization.

## Key Features
- Circular clock-face visualization of daily screen time
- Time category segmentation (Social, Entertainment, Games, Other)
- Proportional radius scaling based on maximum total screen time
- Automated CSV data processing
- Non-interactive output - saves directly to PNG file

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pandas
  matplotlib
  ```
- To install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
## To run the code
```bash
python3 vis.py
```
- Output will be saved in
```bash
screen_time_clockface_scaled_peachy.png
```
